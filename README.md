# Remember

## Clothing

Sturdy shoes (in field practice there might be nocks pointing out of the ground at a low level, etc).

Consider tying hair up.

## Bow grip

As you draw, it changes from a grip to more of a thing bow pushes against, fingers relax, knuckles at 45 degrees.

Want minimum tension in left hand, solid bone line down arm through palm onto bow. Pros actually have the bow fall forward a bit on release, as they're not holding it, it's just braced against their hand.

## Signals penicuik

One whistle: approach line for shooting

Three: approach targets for retrieving arrows

Shout of "FAST": shout the same. Relax a bow if drawn and point down. Remain stationary. Wait for instructions.

## Releasing string

You're just 'slipping off' the string, hand moving back a bit.

## Removing arrows from target

Approach at side, not straight on. 

Look back before pulling arrow out. 

For carbon arrows, you must use a gripper (not bare skin) as they can fragment into splinters.

At penicuik we use aluminium arrows.

## Tab

If shooting a lot or shooting heavy draw, you want tab to protect fingers on string hand.

## Loading the bow safely

Prefer moving arrow 'over' top of bow, rather than inserting it forwards between string and bow. The latter makes it easier to stab your hand.

"Over" can mean bringing arrow vertically pointing up in front of you, then down on the LHS of bow.

## Olympic style (sight)

R hand under chin, want bone contact with top hand/index finger and jaw. People with bears think they are touching properly when they are not! Want string almost touching or touching nose.

Nock: index finger above nock, next two under, leave a little gap so fingers don't touch arrow when you draw.

## Bare bow (no sight)

R hand index finger at corner of mouth.

Nock: three fingers under knock.

Focus on target but move tip of arrow (at draw) over your aim point in foreground.

## Stance

Remain body and head/neck straight up. Don't do an "ussain bolt". 

Practice 'draw' action in front of mirror and check what your torse/head are doing, get used to feeling of doing it correctly.

Personally, it seems that to remain straight and not lean back a bit, I have to feel like I'm leaning forwards ever so slightly while drawing.

## Overthinking

Don't overthink. Strategies: folk do counting up to 10 or think of a song.

## Attaching limbs

The upper limb must have no writing/marks on the back (cheating concern).

## Stringing the bow

The nocking points are off-centre on the string. The side it's off centre to goes at the top of the bow.

Don't forget the strings need to sit in the grooves on the limbs.

## Fletching positions

The odd colour fletching goes straight left. Other two at 45 degree-ish angles from horizontal on riser side.

## Grouping > centre

Good grouping comes first. Once you get grouping, you can adjust aim to move the group.

## Adjusting aim

Olympic sight: Move towards the arrow on target.

Barebow: Move the other way, i.e. aim at opposite point on target.

## UK law

You can shoot on your own property (or anothers with permission). You are still culpable, obviously, for criminal injury/damages.

There are guidelines for safe distances to other people etc even on your own property.

Bow and arrows must be concealed in public.

## Safe practice in home garden or inside

A few BASIC simple principles (by no means complete):

* never shoot towards public areas
* need a good backstop
* the shorter the distance to the target, the safer
* rubber tips over non-wide points mean can't penetrate human skin (but need paddy target or arrows get damaged!)
* always know what is behind backstop
* need clear signage if an area is accessible to someone entering (e.g. a garden gate)
* consider a netting tunnel
* there's an ultra short form with japanese (?) name, look it up again
